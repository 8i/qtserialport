****************************************************************************
*                          Library                                         *
****************************************************************************

 - Improved the Terminal example in which the user can setup a custom serial
   port name.
 - Improved the Enumerator example in which is added the scroll area.
 - Now the Terminal example does not close already closed serial port. It
   allows to suppress an additional messagebox with NotOpenError error.
 - Now the Q_NULLPTR are used where it is possible.

 - QSerialPortInfo:
   * [QTBUG-41262] Now the QSerialPortInfo::isNull() returns true when it
     is empty.
   * Improved the algorithm of serial ports enumeration for Unix-like systems.
     Now does not trying to find out a devices in /dev/, when the udev or the
     sysfs returns nothing.
   * Improved the sysfs backend's algorithm  to enumerate of serial ports
     on Linux.
   * [QTBUG-32024] Fixed detection of valid serial8250 serial ports on Linux.
   * Added detection of Bluetooth SPP (rfcomm) serial port with SysFs backend.

 - QSerialPort:
   * [QTBUG-38639] Allow to use custom (non standard) serial ports paths
     which can be as symlinks, starts with not '/dev' and so on.
   * Fixed leak of handles of events on Windows.
   * Added handling for EINVAL, ENOIOCTLCMD, ENOTTY and EPERM errors on
     Unix-like systems.
   * Now the serial port is marked as opened only if all settings was aplied
     internally. It allows to suppress the NotOpenError when the close()
     method is called from a slot which is connected to the SerialPortError
     signal.
   * Fixed setup an error on Unix-like systems, when the setBaudRate()
     method is failed.
   * Now the serial port does not query a state of RTS and DTR lines when
     opening. It allows to suppress the UnsupportedOperationError error when
     a serial port does not support this feature (for example when using
     socat and so on).
   * [QTBUG-43484] Fixed stalling of reading when the multiple opening and
     closing calls in a row are used.
   * Fixed stalling of reading on Windows when the clear() method are used.
   * Fixed stalling of reading on Windows when the limited buffer size
     are used.
